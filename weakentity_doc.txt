Introduction:
This Python script generates images of weak entites for each entry from a specified column in a CSV file. The script creates two nested rectangles: an outer rectangle based on user-provided dimensions and an inner rectangle that is uniformly padded to ensure consistent spacing around the edges.

Requirements:
Before running the script, ensure the following packages are installed: matplotlib, pandas, and os. These can be installed via pip if not already present in the environment.
Make sure you save the list of names you want to use here into a csv file, so that it would create a df and then list of the names

How to Use the Script:
Input the path where the images should be saved when prompted.
Input the path to the CSV file containing the data.
Provide the name of the column from the CSV that contains the text for the rectangles.
Enter the dimensions for the outer rectangle (ideal width: 1.0, ideal height: 0.6).
Output Description

File Naming and Storage:
Each image is named after the corresponding entry in the CSV column, with spaces replaced by underscores, and saved as a PNG file. The script prints the file path for each image upon successful saving.
